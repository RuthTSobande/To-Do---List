# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

To create an open and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, commit to ensuring that participation in our project and community is free from harassment for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, experience level, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Positive behaviors that contribute to a healthy environment include:

- Using inclusive and welcoming language
- Respecting different viewpoints and experiences
- Accepting constructive feedback gracefully
- Prioritizing the well-being of the community
- Demonstrating empathy towards other community members

Unacceptable behaviors include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insults, derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Sharing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for defining acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and duty to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. This includes using an official project email address, posting through an official social media account, or acting as a designated representative at an online or offline event. Project maintainers may further define and clarify what constitutes representing the project.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported by contacting the project team at tusharnankani3@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, with appropriate responses based on the circumstances. The project team is committed to maintaining confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not adhere to or enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent consequences as decided by the project's leadership.
